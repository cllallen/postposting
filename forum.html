    <h1>An interview with my friends Michaela and Delia <3</h1>
    <p><i>Michaela and Delia are two very good friends of mine who have grown up online in a similar manner to me...of course, I had to include their thoughts on online-existence in this project!</i></p>
    <p><i>This interview was conducted over Google Docs between March 19 and March 25, 2024.</i></p>
    <p><b>1. Introduce yourselves! Name, age, where you're from, favourite movie, anything!</b></p>
    <p>d: hiiii!!! my name is delia, and i'm currently 19! i was born in toronto, but have lived in barrie for most of my life :) im currently in my 2nd year of nursing at mcmaster uiversity and i love art, music, anime, rotting in bed, and my boyfriend</p>
    <p>m: Hi!!! I'm Michaela. I'm 20 and I'm taking General Arts and Science at Georgian College (in Barrie, where I live) right now. I'm super excited to be transferring to UofT this fall. I love literature, music, history, being in nature, and my most wonderful partner. My caffeinated beverage of choice will always be matcha.</p>
    <p><b>2. What is your first memory on the Internet? Is there any one distinct moment, or did it just kind of materialize mysteriously into your life?</b></p>
    <p>d: i can’t remember my absolute first time using the internet, but i distinctly remember when i was super young and discovered youtube, i would watch a lot of music videos and there was one time i clicked on a fake youtube video and it was a justin bieber video and they edited him to look creepy and i was so freaked out LOL, i shut the laptop (it was my grandmas) and lowkey she probably would have seen it when she opened it so im sorry grandma</p>
    <p>m: I got my first phone for Christmas in grade five. It was really exciting, and that was when the internet took a huge shift from something to use at school and became the internet I know now. I had been on Instagram since the year before, but a smartphone really changes your relationship with the Internet. Like how your phone becomes an extension of your body, the internet became an extension of my mind around this time. I remember beginning to interact with strangers’ posts on Instagram, YouTube, and Pinterest and that’s when things changed. </p>
    <p><B>3. How do you think the Internet has changed since you first started using it to now? Do you think it's better now? Worse? Why?</B></p>
    <p>d:  i had social media at a young age but it was mostly to communicate with friends from school. now at an older age, you really start to recognize how edited social media can be, and how damaging it can be for self-esteem. the internet is also just so much more accessible; more people from all age groups are on the internet now; and there’s so much content being posted daily that it’s literally impossible to keep up with. i wouldn’t say the internet itself is worse; i think its always been a resource that depending on the purpose can be very educational or very damaging. but with the increase of social media and the majority of children growing up on devices; it's probably more harmful than good especially without parental supervision. personally for me i’m sort of in the middle with internet usage. it’s a very nuanced question to definitively decide if it’s better or worse because there are just so many different purposes for the internet; entertainment, research, communication, etc. </p>
    <p>m: In most ways, I don’t think the Internet has changed since I started using it. Of course, I started using it differently and interacting with different parts of the Internet as my interests developed, but I think the Internet itself has largely stayed the same. If you ask me, what’s changed is the way people act in the real world because of the Internet…it’s become an environment, and our environments shape us. Look at the way peoples’ attention spans are shrinking and the kids who go down the alt right pipeline. But we also shape our environments, so of course the Internet has changed as technology and culture have evolved over the past 40 years of the internet, and the last 10 years that I’ve been using it. I can’t give you a straight answer because there’s so many things to consider! I think I’d have to write you a paper of my own. LOL. </p>
    <p><b>4. Do you like social media? Do you think it’s fun? Do you think it rots your brain? Both? Elaborate.</b></p>
    <p>d: omg i love social media i’m sorry i’m literally just a girl who is chronically online. i try to make sure my feed is content i’m interested in and makes me happy; because of how often we are on social media i think it should definitely be something that’s mainly positive and benefits you in some manner (but i’m kind of hypocritical in this sense bc a lot of the time i am just doing mindless scrolling LOL) but i find out a lot of news from social media as well so that’s a definite plus. It probably has rotted my brain to some extent but i’m able to manage my time pretty well so that i can have my phone time but my studies are my #1 priority atm (final szn is killing me claire PLeeaase help me).</p>
    <p>m: I love social media. I’ve always loved curating my Instagram feed and finding new cool girls to follow and be inspired by. I’m not diagnosed, but I also highly suspect that I’m neurodivergent and social media came to be something I relied on to know how to act. Like a rule book.  I would literally study my peers’ profiles to figure out how I was supposed to be behaving on social media, and in real life too. I follow a lot of writers, museums, galleries, and artists on Instagram too, so I love to see their content. It’s the pictures, longer form video content, and text that I have fun with on social media. Short form videos? Absolutely rots my brain into a sad grey puddle. I still use Instagram and watch Instagram Reels, but I find it so much easier to switch back to reality. If I could choose to disable Reels I absolutely would in a heartbeat!!!! But we know how the Zuck feels about consumer feedback. </p>
    <p><b>5. What is one thing about the Internet you wish you could import into real life?</b></p>
    <p>d: lowkey cats i get so many cat videos on tiktok and they’re so cute (my cat coco is my favourite obviously) but omg cats. But also i agree with michaela if i could teleport the people i talk to on a daily basis into real life i think i would be exponentially happier.</p>
    <p>m: I wish I could talk to my friends in real life whenever I wanted. There are certain friends (cough cough) who are so busy, and I’m so busy too, that none of us can make our schedules work, but the Internet lets us keep our friendship active. The bond would still be there without the Internet, but why wouldn’t you want to talk to your best friends or partner whenever you can? In the same vein, I wish I could surround myself with people I had similar interests with in real life. My school doesn’t help Liberal Arts students foster relationships or make connections at all, so it’s a challenge to meet like-minded people for me right now. Thank you Tinder for connecting me with my like-minded boyfriend!</p>
    <p><b>6. If you could change one thing about the Internet, what would it be?</b></p>
    <p>d: this is probably so unserious but chain mail that terrified me as a kid i literally thought i would die if i didn’t send this thread clearly created by a 10 year old to 15 different people within 5 minutes (this was probably an early sign of my anxiety Tbh 11 year old delia u are completely fine if you don’t send something a ghost lady will not appear in your bedroom at 3am) but on a serious manner just the possibility to remove hate comments like anywhere there can be such toxic spaces online why are we spreading negativity that is not girly behaviour, and definitely cyberbullying as well because that ruins so many people’s lives and if that were removed from the internet entirely i think the world would definitely be a better place</p>
    <p>m: Andrew Tate, Jordan Peterson, PragerU videos all the time, Joe Rogan, Chaya Raichik, Ben Shapiro, Freelee the Banana Girl, Onision, Pearl Davis, Nick Fuentes, Alex Jones……… the list goes on.</p>
    <p><b>7. Do you like who you are online? How do you think the online version of you is similar to the real life version of you? How do you think it is different?</b></p>
    <p>d: honestly i don’t really post too much on social media; mostly on my close friends story on instragram and honestly i overshare on there way too much, but i do like who i am on social media i think its a pretty accurate representation of myself. That being said i think being online for me provides a sense of security i feel very free to share my personal thoughts and struggles without much thought about who’s seeing it since my close friends story  which honestly i should double check who is on there because i am oversharing way too much these days</p>
    <p>m: Right now, my online version of myself is more representative of how I want to be than the way I perform at school and in the real world. It’s fairly close, but my online persona is always more creative, beautiful, mysterious, intelligent, and funny than my uncalculated and significantly less polished self in real life. I guess that makes my real life self more authentic, but my online persona also lets me experiment with avenues of expression before I work up the courage to behave or present a certain way in real life. It’s true that it’s easier to act a certain way behind a screen, and I think that has been a positive thing for a lot of kind people (the same cannot be said for a significant portion of Internet users) who just want to be cool and explore all facets of their identities in a safe environment.</p>
