        <h1><b>The Post-Internet Manifesto</b> (also known as the Postposting Manifesto)</h1>
            <p>Is something that must be typed, I am normally one for handwriting but this must be typed</p>
        <h3>1. The internet is a medium that must be met on its own terms (and conditions, of course, those must not be forgotten)</h3>
            <p>It provides novel methods but really, there is nothing novel about it at all, it just circulates everything that already was but in an unfamiliar realm. Hito Steyerl has written on this, Aria Dean has analyzed it as well, she has a quote that goes "When we say that the internet extends and exacerbates the same old offline relations, <b>we mean it</b>."</p>
        <h3>2. Everything has a precedent and precedents may be updated at any given moment, precedents can become precedent within a matter of seconds--there is little time for marination</h3>
            <p>Ease of access to everything, everything, all information and a writing tool makes the cursor on the top of the pixelated cake, but please note that often the cake will seemingly materialize out of thin air/nowhere, people omit their citations often, The Cake Is A Lie</p>
        <h3>3. Esoterism is rampant here and this is to be embraced, Symbolic Efficiency has degraded so greatly that it can all be considered at least somewhat meaningless</h3>
            <p>Whether or not it *should* be taken as meaningless is another question, but one that can only be investigated from the inside, once you have stupid semiotic jokes and codes with your friends you may find yourself less inclined to symbolic efficiency</p>
        <h3>4. One must remember their identity and values in spite of affection, so as not to lose their sense of self among The Marvellous Clouds</h3>
            <p>It is easy to forget one's body in this place but you must remember that you cannot plug your cognater into your computer, they cannot be cognate, no matter how much fun this becomes they must always remain separate so as to maintain necessary perspective on these worlds--this should be a fun place</p>
        <h3>5. Nothing is to be taken too seriously, language and dress here are casual this is reflected in our conversation</h3>
            <p>In fact a lot of important punctuation is left out, crucial apostrophes and such, so everything can be taken with a grain of salt, see rule 3. Everything on here lies somewhere on the spectrum of Symbolic Efficiency and salt</p>
        <h3>6. There is a lot of sludge. You can collect it or you can yell at it but often you can't get rid of it so you'll need to learn to coexist with it if you want to stick around</h3>
        <h3>7. Everything is always ongoing, iterative,</h3>
